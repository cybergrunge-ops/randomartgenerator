quick and silly idea uses p5.js to randomly assemble images with various filters and mixing techniques

randomart2.html has inline script, requires p5.min.js, and uses alpha masks from a "masks/" folder

randomart.html requires script.js and p5 minified

as in use on my website uses the folder tinypic18/ for images, as i use for input some 10,000 images scraped from tinypic by Archive Team on archive.org
